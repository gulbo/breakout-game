# breakout-game
The famous Breakout game implemented on a NXP LPC1768 ARM development board with CMSIS-RTOS RTX real-time operating system. This version of RTX implements the CMSIS-RTOS API, which is a generic RTOS interface for Cortex-M processor-based devices. The CMSIS-RTOS API provides a standardized interface for software components that require RTOS functionality.

This work has been commissioned to us as a special project, during the Computer Architectures course at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2017/2018.

## User Interface
To interact with the board the user can use the buttons. A GUI is implemented on the display to guide the user. Also sounds are played during the game by the integrated buzzer.
